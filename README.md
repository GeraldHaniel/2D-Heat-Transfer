2D-Heat-Transfer
================
##Theory - Physics
When we divide a 2-D plate which is in steady state condition(ie. there is no more temperature variation in a point with respect to time), We find:
>- temp = f(posX, posY)
>- temp(m, n) approx= (temp(m, n-1) + temp(m, n+1) + temp(m-1, n) + temp(m+1, n)) / 4
